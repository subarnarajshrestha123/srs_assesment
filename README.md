My assignment was to build a GIF picker that allows users to search for a GIF and copy or share it
to their favorite chat program. It should use GIPHY's API to generate GIFs. The API is limited to 42 requests per hour, 1000 per day. You need to make a free account, go to your developer dashboard, create an app, and that will provide you with the API key necessary.

## Requirements
- GIFs should render using the MP4 format
- App should load in under 1.5s
- It should work in the most modern browsers
- Enough styling that the app is usable and presentable
- Use your modern UI framework of choice Aurelia/React/Vue/etc.
- An AJAX/Fetch library as well as a utility library for things like encoding query parameters or debouncing/throttling is acceptable. No other libraries or plugins are acceptable.
- A publicly available URL where the app will live through a service like now,  netlify , surge, codepen, glitch, or similar.

### Features
Features are listed in priority, some are more difficult than others. Accomplish as many as you feel comfortable.

#### Core
- A user should have a clear way to search for GIFs.
- A user should be able to make their own queries to search for GIFs.
- A user should be able to easily copy the GIF URL to a chat program.

#### Nice to Have
- A user should get results shortly after they're finshed typing.
- A user should be able to cycle through many GIFs for each search query.
- A user should be alerted when the API limit is reached.
- A user should be able to see previous results even after the API limit is reached.
- A user should be able to see 3 random gifs before searching.
